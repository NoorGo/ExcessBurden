# Needed on your computer before you start:
BCode version 1.4 is needed for the calculations of the excess burden and disease burden. 
Excel was used to calculate the incidence, make sheets to load in the BCode toolkit and create the figures. 

# Branch "Burden calculation documents"
# Sheets to load into the BCode toolkit
In order to get the results from the BCode toolkit, one must load "models" into the toolkit.
Be sure that you load each model separetely and than run the model. 
After running one model and getting the results you can shut down the toolkit, start it back up and load another model to get the results. 
We experienced problems when loading in different models and then running them, therefore we recommend loading and running one model at the time. 

Documents "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-resist_params_w_ITALY_inc" and "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-susc_params_w_ITALY_inc" provide the data needed to load a model into the BCoode toolkit version 1.4.
After running the model, you will get the results which be copied to excel by clicking with the right mouse buttom on the results in the BCOde toolkit. 

Documents "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-resist_params_age-indep-mort_w_ITALY_inc" and "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-susc_params_age-indep-mort_w_ITALY_inc" provide age independent mortality data to load into the toolkit. This can be used as a sensitivity analysis. 

# Excess burden calculations
The excess burden is thus calculated as the burden of resistant bacteria - the burden of susceptible bacteria with a simulated identical incidence. 
In other words, the burden results of "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-resist_params_w_ITALY_inc" - "DONE_TOOLKIT_IT-susc_params_w_ITALY_inc". 
We also did this in an Excel sheet. This sheet is named "Excess calculations" and for the age independent analysis "Excess calculations age indepeent".

# Branch "Incidence Calculation"
# Data used to calculate the incidence in Italy
The incidence was calculated in an excel sheet. The steps have been described in the paper. 
The steps are also described briefly in the excel file "Incidence calculation Italy based on population 1.25 mil 57271"

# Branch "Main"
# Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
The Excel document "Final Figures 2-7 05 01 2022" contains figures 2 to 7 and the data needed to create the figures.
